🔍 What likely went wrong
✅ scrollRef.current.scrollLeft = ... logic is correct

❌ But it runs before the layout is fully ready, or the containerWidth is still 0

That means the scroll instruction runs too early — and gets ignored or scrolls to the wrong place.

✅ Refined Prompt for Codex
The logic to scroll the Gantt chart to center the "Today" line still does not work.

Please fix this so that:

---

### ✅ GOAL

- On page load, the **scroll container (scrollRef)** should automatically scroll so that the "Today" vertical line is **centered** in the visible area.
- This scroll must happen **only after layout is complete** and `containerWidth` is known.

---

### 🔍 Problem Source

Even though this line is correct:
```ts
scrollRef.current.scrollLeft =
  (todayOffset / totalRange) * containerWidth + LABEL_WIDTH - scrollRef.current.clientWidth / 2;
It likely runs too early, when containerWidth is still 0.

✅ Fix Instructions
Wrap the scroll logic in useLayoutEffect (not useEffect):

This ensures it runs after layout and size calculation.

Use a hasScrolledRef.current = true flag to run it only once

Add containerWidth > 0 as a condition before executing scroll

Use correct dependencies:
useLayoutEffect(() => {
  if (
    !hasScrolledRef.current &&
    containerWidth > 0 &&
    scrollRef.current &&
    totalRange > 0
  ) {
    scrollRef.current.scrollLeft =
      (todayOffset / totalRange) * containerWidth +
      LABEL_WIDTH -
      scrollRef.current.clientWidth / 2;
    hasScrolledRef.current = true;
  }
}, [containerWidth, totalRange, todayOffset]);
You can compute todayOffset inside this effect too if needed.

✅ After this fix, the chart should automatically center on today's date when it renders.
